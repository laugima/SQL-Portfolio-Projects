# SQL-Portfolio-Projects
Here you will find SQL projects that have been created as part of my Portfolio. 


### 1. Data Cleansing Project:
**Description:**
This project involves a comprehensive data cleansing process designed to enhance the quality and reliability of contributed datasets. The objective is to prepare the data for analysis by performing several critical tasks:
- **Duplicate Removal:** Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to ensure that each entry is unique and accurate.
- **Data Standardization:** Converting data into a consistent format to facilitate easier analysis and comparison.
- **Handling Null or Empty Values:** Addressing missing data through imputation or removal to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
- **Data Pruning:** Removing unnecessary or irrelevant data to streamline the dataset and improve its usability.
The outcome is a refined dataset that is clean, standardized, and ready for further analysis.


### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project:
**Description:**
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where the goal is to analyze and interpret complex datasets to uncover meaningful insights. Key activities include:
- **Data Exploration:** Investigating the dataset through various techniques such as summary statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies within the data that could lead to valuable insights.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Formulating and testing hypotheses to draw conclusions that are actionable and relevant to real-world scenarios.
- **Insight Generation:** Providing data-driven recommendations based on the findings to inform decision-making processes.
The project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights that can be applied in practical situations.
